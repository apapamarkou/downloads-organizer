# Downloads Organizer

**Downloads Organizer** is a background utility designed to keep your Downloads folder tidy and your home directory well-organized. It monitors incoming files in your Downloads directory and helps you manage them based on their typesâ€”such as documents, videos, pictures, packages, disk images and archives.

When new files are detected, Downloads Organizer prompts you to optionally rename and move them to appropriate folders according to your preferences. For applications and packages, it will ask if you want to install them. For archives and compressed files, it offers to extract them and select the extraction location.

The tool features an intuitive GUI for configuring default folders for various file types and for enabling or disabling specific actions based on the type of downloaded files.

## Features
